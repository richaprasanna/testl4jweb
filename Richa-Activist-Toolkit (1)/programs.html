        <p>Our dynamic organization offers handwritten curriculum designed for youth BY youth. Our curriculum teaches our various subjects in a way that highlights social change and inspires youth to create a change in their own communities. We offer programs, such as Speech and Debate, Journalism, Creative Writing, Cultural Connections, and are expanding. We belive every subject can create social change and youth should be able to gain a passion and drive for social change from everyday subjects.</p>

          <h2>Justice and Journalism: Exploring the Voices of Youth</h2>
          <p class = "spacing-p">Through this workshop, we aim to empower young children to speak up in a society that often overlooks their voices. By creating a safe and supportive environment, we encourage confidence and active listening, breaking the cycle that favors only the loudest voices and challenges stereotypes about introverted individuals.

          <h2>International Impact: Global Changemakers Program</h2>
          <p class = "spacing-p">We host a yearly online international program for teenagers worldwide intersted in social justice, advocacy, and meeting new people. Our program in both 2023 and 2024 has had over 40 people from countries all over Asia, Africa, South America, and North America. Every week for 5 weeks during the summer, they come together to converse about a new social justice issue every week. Through the program, they learn more about different countries, cultures, and ways of advocacy in workshop style sessions. For the remaining time, they discuss different social justice issues with other participants and share their own experiences. This program culminates in a final group project to discuss one specific social justice issue in detail in a creative format.</p>
