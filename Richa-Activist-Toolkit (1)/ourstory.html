          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p class = "spacing-p">Our founder, Thy, wanted to create a place where passionate teens could teach youth about social change. Being involved in poetry + social justice herself, she wanted to gather a group of people to spread the message of change in her local community. She knows that CHILDREN ARE THE FUTURE, so it is in our society's best interest and their own best interest to teach curriculum through a social justice lens. Our beginnings were humble with a group of 4 including Thy herself, the current co-executive director Richa, and 2 others, but they did the work and were able to develop Speech and Debate Curriculum. Following the success and impact of their first set of curriculum in underfunded schools, Learn4Justice expanded and aims to teach as many subjects as possible through a social justice lens. Now we have an executive team of high schoolers who work towards spreading justice in their local communities. Soon our platform expanded, and we've had the privilege of hosting a yearly international camp amongst high schoolers worldwide to network and talk about social justice issues!</p>
          <p class = "spacing-p">There is lack of curriculum is many fields that integrates social justice and real life issues in the curriculum, specifically for youth. Our members have seen the lack fo awareness towards social justice issues and skills at a young age for children with many of these subjects being thought of as just useless or not real subjects. Children are not taught the application of subjects in their own world and should be taught to the skills <b>TO GIVE THEM THE ABILITY FOR OTHERS TO HEAR THEIR VOICE</b></p>
          <p class = "spacing-p" id = "motto">We aim to <b>EDUCATE, CREATE, AND INSPIRE</b> the next generation of LOCAL and GLOBAL changemakers and activists</p>
